	<p>A Master’s qualification is a postgraduate degree course that individuals can pursue once they have completed their undergraduate degree.

This in-depth level of study is the most popular postgraduate option within the UK as it enables individuals to further their knowledge in their area of interest or to enter a different field to their undergraduate degree.

In some cases, it can better your chances of employment and boost your career prospects.

There are 18,529 Masters Degrees in the UK with a huge range of courses and qualifications available across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

So, if you are thinking about pursuing a master’s degree, there is tons of choice when it comes to your chosen subject.A master’s degree normally takes one or two years if studied full time or two to four years’ if studied part time.

The qualification is a Level 7 which means it is above bachelor’s degrees but below PhDs.

Studying for this degree level is intense and they are normally worth 180 credits, which is 60 credits above an undergrad study.

You’ll find that studying for a master’s degree is similar to an undergraduate in the way they are taught. This is because they consist of lectures, seminars and assignments, with work assessed by exams, essays, dissertations and group projects.

Similarly, to an undergraduate, students are expected to work independently but receive support from their tutors and lecturers.

Depending on the chosen subject and university, you may have to have received a 2.1 in your Bachelors and relevant work experience, however, this varies so it’s worth researching different requirements.

Studying for a master’s degree may be harder than your undergraduate study as there is a larger workload and more dedication required because you’re focusing on a specialist topic and gaining in depth knowledge.

Although, the length of study is shorter, your class sizes are smaller, and you can do a lot of the work at home as they tend to be more flexible.

This level of study is really what you make of it, if you’re determined and ready to work hard then go for it. It’s similar jumping from your a-level studies to your undergraduate study!A master’s degree in the UK costs less in tuition fees than a bachelor’s with an average cost of around £8,740.

However, the money aspects will vary depending on different subject areas, universities and the country you’re completing your study.

The price for UK Master’s programmes are decided by universities themselves so they aren’t subject to a cap like undergraduate degree fees are.

Master’s are normally higher in costs for international students too so it’s something you should look into if you’re an overseas graduate.

All individuals will also need to bear in mind living costs and other study expenses whilst choosing this postgraduate option.

You’ll be able to check out postgraduate fees when you search for courses.

The UK government offers postgraduate student loans up to the value of £10,609 no matter whether you are doing a one year, two tear, three year or four-year course.

This means if your tuition fees and living costs are higher than that, you will have to get additional income to cover your costs whether it’s from scholarships, grants, bursaries or from a job.

Just like your bachelor’s degree you have to begin repaying your loan and average debt when your income reaches a certain amount (the threshold).There are many advantages of master’s programs with studies showing that they can increase your chances of employment and can boost your lifetime earnings.

One study found that 76.5% of postgraduates are employed in highly skilled roles compared to 65.4% of graduates.

Whilst another study found that postgraduates are 11% more likely to be in full-time
